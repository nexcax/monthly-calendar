# monthly-calendar
A project to list a date range, providing the number of days and show in a calendar view.

## Angular 6 version
Used Angular 6 framework for build all the interface using Angular material just for layouts.

To start the project just use the angular-cli and run into the folder angular-version the following command:

```
ng serve
```

And open the server in the url: http://localhost:4200

For a quick access to application the simplest way is launch index.html file located in the path: 

angular-version/dist/angular-version/index.html

## Other deploys

 If you want to use the builded project, it is located in dist/angular-version/ folder, for this is neccesary that you have installed node, just check if you have installed it using the following command:

 ```
 node --version
 ```

 If you haven't, got to istallation page for your OS at: https://nodejs.org/es/download/package-manager/.

 When you have node go to the folder dist/angular/version/ and run npm start.

In case that you only have the dist folder outside of the project, is necessary to place the folder in a web-server (Ex: Nginx, apache, http-server) and open it in the configured port of the server.
